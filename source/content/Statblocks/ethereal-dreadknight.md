# Ethereal Dreadknight

## Lore

Ethereal Dreadknights are the cursed remnants of once-noble warriors who bargained with dark powers to escape death. Their pact granted them immortality, but at a terrible cost—they exist partially in the Ethereal Plane, forever trapped between life and death, solid and spectral.

These terrifying undead warriors serve dark masters or pursue their own inscrutable vendettas, phasing in and out of reality to strike at their enemies. Their touch drains the very life force from the living, and their presence radiates an aura of death that withers all nearby.

## Tactics

An Ethereal Dreadknight is a cunning combatant that uses its planar mobility to devastating effect:

- **Opening Move**: Uses Dreadful Presence and Death's Aura to soften up groups of enemies
- **Hit and Run**: Shifts to the Ethereal Plane with Ethereal Jaunt, repositions, then returns to make devastating melee attacks
- **Ranged Harassment**: Uses Phase Strike from the Ethereal Plane where it's safe from most attacks
- **Finishing Blow**: Uses Soul Drain on wounded enemies to heal itself and eliminate threats
- **Legendary Actions**: Maintains pressure with Phase Strikes and repositioning, saving Soul Rend for clustered enemies

## Encounter Ideas

- **The Phantom Castle**: The dreadknight haunts an abandoned fortress, phasing through walls to ambush intruders
- **Vengeful Spirit**: Hired by a necromancer to eliminate those who wronged it in life
- **Bridge Guardian**: Guards a planar rift between the Material and Ethereal Planes
- **The Hunt**: Pursues the party relentlessly, appearing when they least expect it
